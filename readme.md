# inspectlet

A bookmarklet you can install to use the inspector and JS console.

There are two bookmarkets you need to install. `inject.js` injects the code required to complete the connection, and `inspectlet.js` opens the inspector in a new tab. Note it is highly probable the JS console, or even the injection, will not work due to security features.
